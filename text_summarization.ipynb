Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation.

This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: In his departing speech, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five years as President of India, expressing gratitude for the diverse interactions he's had with people from all walks of life. He highlights ten key messages from his experiences and emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich culture and civilization while pursuing economic growth. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Accelerate development:** Fueled by the aspirations of the 540 million youth, with a vision of developing India by 2020. Kalam underscores this goal throughout his speech, seeing it as a shared dream.\n",
      "* **Empower villages:** Provide financial and physical connectivity to enable rural development and connect villages with urban centers. Kalam cites the example of Periyar PURA, a model of sustainable economic development where villages are engaged in cultivation, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. This program, with support from institutions like Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women and JETRO, has allowed villagers to develop internationally competitive products.\n",
      "* **Mobilize rural expertise:** Utilize the skills and resources of rural communities to drive national competitiveness through initiatives like PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas). Kalam emphasizes the need for 7000 PU RAs across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "* **\"Seed to Food\" initiative:**  Supporting agricultural growth. Kalam emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, improving the economic conditions of the nation through this initiative. He encourages a partnership between farmers, scientists, and industries for value addition in agriculture.\n",
      "* **Overcome challenges:** Through perseverance and problem-solving. This message is illustrated by Kalam's meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man born without hands or legs who found joy and purpose in life despite his challenges, and also by his visit to Urusa village after the devastating earthquake in 2005, where he witnessed the indomitable spirit of the people. Kalam emphasizes that challenges should be seen as opportunities to learn and grow. He recounts meeting the people of Car Nicobar Islands who, after the devastating Tsunami, showed incredible resilience and adopted the victims as their own, embodying a spirit of unity and courage.\n",
      "* **Collaborative approach:** Addressing issues through partnerships.\n",
      "* **Courage in adversity:**  Facing calamities head-on. Kalam's experiences in Urusa and Car Nicobar serve as powerful examples of this.\n",
      "* **Connectivity as a driver:** For societal transformation.  Kalam highlights his initiative for a Pan African e-Network, proposing a seamless network connecting 53 African countries through satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology. This project aims to connect universities, hospitals, tele-medicine centers, and tele-education centers across the continent, exemplified by the pilot project in Ethiopia where the Indira Gandhi National Open University provides MBA courses to Ethiopian students.\n",
      "    * Kalam also notes the successful implementation of tele-consultations between doctors in Hyderabad and Addis Ababa, highlighting the network's potential for bridging healthcare gaps. \n",
      "* **National defense:** A source of pride. Kalam emphasizes his pride in meeting soldiers, sailors, and air warriors, witnessing their dedication and courage firsthand. \n",
      "* **Youth-led movement:** For a developed India by 2020.  He concludes by recalling a question from a young girl who inspired him to work towards a developed India by 2020.  Touched by her vision, Kalam assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked towards making it a reality. He highlights initiatives like the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which are empowering youth to become enlightened citizens through value-based education and leadership. This is exemplified by the transformative impact seen in students from Andhra Pradesh who participated in the Lead India 2020 Training Camp, showcasing increased self-discipline, love for family and teachers, and a stronger sense of national duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also envisions a future India characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* A nation where the best of health care is available to all\n",
      "* A nation where the governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption free\n",
      "* A nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiteracy removed and crimes against women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation that continues with a sustainable growth path\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam's departure speech underscores his belief in the power of India's youth and the importance of collaborative efforts, innovation, and resilience in shaping a brighter future for the nation.  He envisions a developed India by 2020 characterized by reduced rural-urban divide, equitable access to resources, and a thriving economy fueled by a synergy between agriculture, industry, and services. \n",

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.
